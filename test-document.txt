This is a test document for file upload functionality.

It contains some sample text that can be used to test the OpenAI file search capabilities.

Key information:
- This document is about testing file uploads
- It should be processed by OpenAI's vector store
- Users should be able to search through this content
- The file attachment should display properly in the chat interface

Additional content:
The file upload system supports various file types including:
- Text files (.txt)
- Markdown files (.md)
- PDF documents (.pdf)
- Word documents (.doc, .docx)
- PowerPoint presentations (.pptx)
- Code files (.js, .py, .java, etc.)

When a file is uploaded, it goes through the following process:
1. File is uploaded to the server
2. File is sent to OpenAI for processing
3. File is added to a vector store for search capabilities
4. File status is updated to "ready" when processing is complete
5. Users can then ask questions about the file content

This test document should help verify that all these steps work correctly.
